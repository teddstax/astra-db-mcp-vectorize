# Astra DB MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for interacting with Astra DB. MCP extends the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by allowing them to interact with external systems as agents.

## Prerequisites

You need to have a running Astra DB database. If you don't have one, you can create a free database [here](https://astra.datastax.com/register). From there, you can get two things you need:

1. An Astra DB Application Token
2. The Astra DB API Endpoint

To learn how to get these, please [read the getting started docs](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-db-serverless/api-reference/dataapiclient.html#set-environment-variables).

## Adding to an MCP client

Here's how you can add this server to your MCP client.

### Claude Desktop

![Claude Desktop](https://github.com/datastax/astra-db-mcp/raw/main/docs/img/claude-settings.png)

To add this to [Claude Desktop](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-desktop), go to Preferences -> Developer -> Edit Config and add this JSON blob to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "astra-db-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@datastax/astra-db-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN": "your_astra_db_token",
        "ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT": "your_astra_db_endpoint"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Windows PowerShell Users:**
`npx` is a batch command so modify the JSON as follows:

```json
  "command": "cmd",
  "args": ["/k", "npx", "-y", "@datastax/astra-db-mcp"],
```

### Cursor

![Cursor](https://github.com/datastax/astra-db-mcp/raw/main/docs/img/cursor-settings.png)

To add this to [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), go to Settings -> Cursor Settings -> MCP

From there, you can add the server by clicking the "+ Add New MCP Server" button, where you should be brought to an `mcp.json` file.

> **Tip**: there is a `~/.cursor/mcp.json` that represents your Global MCP settings, and a project-specific `.cursor/mcp.json` file
> that is specific to the project. You probably want to install this MCP server into the project-specific file.

Add the same JSON as indiciated in the Claude Desktop instructions.

Alternatively you may be presented with a wizard, where you can enter the following values (for Unix-based systems):

- Name: Whatever you want
- Type: Command
- Command:

```sh
env ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN=your_astra_db_token ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT=your_astra_db_endpoint npx -y @datastax/astra-db-mcp
```

Once added, your editor will be fully connected to your Astra DB database.
